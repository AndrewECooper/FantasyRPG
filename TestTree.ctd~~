		<rich_text>This project is really very personal to me. It is a mixture of a Fantasy Heartbreaker and an attempt at an Old School Renaissance game. I've been doing this hobby now since 1989. My first game was an AD&amp;D 1st Edition campaign that changed over to 2nd Edition almost immediately after I started playing. Since those halcyon days I have played numerous games ranging from very traditional to bleeding edge indie. I've enjoyed a bit of everything. Dogs in the Vineyard may be one of the best games ever created. Capes is superb. However, over the last several months as I've contemplated introducing the hobby of role-playing to my own children I've wandered back around to my own beginnings.  

  
See, Old School to me doesn't mean the Red Box Set or OD&amp;D or whatnot. It means 2nd Edition. I cut my teeth on that game. I had a blast with that game. I want a game that captures the spirit of 2nd Edition but either cuts out or improves on broken/convoluted parts of the game. Lot's of things have advanced and improved with role-playing in general and D&amp;D specifically over the years. I've got no desire to toss out every new improvement to the game. If that were the case, I'd just go back to playing 2nd Edition straight up.  Instead I want to keep the parts of the game I remember fondly while modifying the parts that I remember annoying me.  

  
What is this game?  Perhaps it would be easier to say what it is not.  

  
It is not a ground breaking game of new unique mechanics. I mean this. I've taken the 1st and 2nd Edition chassis and tacked on a lot of rules and techniques that I've picked up from other games over the years. If you are reading through the rules here and you say to yourself, &quot;Self, that looks like a rule from &lt;insert cool game here&gt;.&quot;, it probably is that exact rule ported over to here. I likely saw it over in said game, liked it and copy/pasted it right over here. I'm going to try to list all the games I've stolen from in the credits but frankly I'm not sure I'll remember them all. If I forget one, let me know and I'll add it.  

  
So, what is this game then?  

  
* It is a Frankenstein Monster created from the harvested parts of other great games.  
* It is 1st/2nd Edition AD&amp;D upgraded to the way I like to play.  
* It is easily hackable.  
* It values player rulings rather than having a rule for everything.  
* It is very traditional in its setup with a GM and players.  

  
If that sounds like something you'd be interested in perusing, here it is. Peruse until your little heart is content. Play the game if you like. Hack the hell out of it. Make it your own. I intend to. If that sounds like a crappy game that you'd hate, move on along to the next game. Not every game has to be enjoyed by everyone. It doesn't make this a bad game or you a bad person. It just means this isn't going to float your boat. I wish you luck and happiness playing whatever game you settle upon.

		<rich_text>Saying something is a role-playing game is classifying it so broadly that it is almost useless as a description. Polaris and GURPS are both role-playing games but other than some commonalities like having characters and there being a plot, there's almost nothing about them that is the same. So, I'm going to avoid the stupid section that is in most game books that attempts to define what a role-playing game is. That's like tilting at windmills. Instead, I'm going to tell you what I created this game to be and how to play it at your table.  
</rich_text>
		<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="What's the Point?" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="3">
			<rich_text>That's a very interesting question. The point of this game is to collectively tell fun and engaging fantasy adventure stories with lots of magic, action and combat. The players create interesting fantasy characters with cool abilities and then challenge them with powerful villains and monsters and difficult obstacles and see how those characters fare.

			<rich_text>You win by entertaining both yourself and the other players at the table with your ingenuity, creativity and good old-fashioned chutzpah. You win by beating the bad guys, fighting with monsters, discovering treasures making a difference in the fictional world. If you and your friends create characters and a world that causes you to become invested in the events there and you all look forward to the game to see what happens...  you win!

			<rich_text>Well, since the point of the game is telling stories, let's look at the elements of a story. There's character, setting, conflict, plot and theme.  
  
One player takes on the job of Gamemaster (GM). This player is primarily responsible for the setting. The other players each control 1 or more of the primary characters (the heroes) in the story.  
  
In play, the GM sets the initial scene (like an author starting a book) and the other players describe how the characters that they control react (also like an author) to the elements of the scene. The players are responsible for having their characters pursue with great vigor the parts of the situation that interest them. The GM is responsible for throwing interesting and challenging obstacles in their way. This interaction of pursuing goals within the setting and creating challenging opposition allows all the players to create conflict, plot and theme during play together.  
  
At the table you'll do most of that verbally through talking to one another. You might also use some play aids such as maps and miniatures. When the rules systems are engaged players roll dice and use the outcomes to alter the situation. Puzzles are presented and solved. Battles are set up and tactics decided. Players might act out scenes as their characters.  
</rich_text>
			<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="Gamemaster Responsibilities" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="6">
				<rich_text>Develop the setting. That doesn't mean that the entire universe that the characters inhabit has to be detailed. It does mean that enough of the setting for the characters to interact with has to be properly though out. How much that is really depends on the scope of the game. Games revolving around one small village and its surroundings will have a bit smaller scope than a game of travelling mercenaries that move from place to place and kingdom to kingdom.  

Make memorable non-player characters. The players generally each control one character. That means all the other people that inhabit the setting are up to the GM. Of course some of these characters don't have to be very detailed. The shopkeeper at the general store might not be all that important in a town the player characters are just passing through. However, the many characters that the players interact with that are important need to come to life. After all, if the villain isn't interesting or memorable it will be difficult for the players to become invested in opposing him.  
  
Prepare appropriate challenges. Challenges need to be appropriate in both theme and difficulty. Slap-stick comedy challenges in a serious and gritty game are not generally well-received. Challenges that are too easy or too hard either bore or frustrate players.  
  
Watch the players and respond to what they like. Hooking characters into a cool situation isn't hard if you watch the players and simply develop the situation around what they have indicated through verbal and nonverbal cues they like and are jazzed about. Trying to hook them into something they don't like will frustrate you and bore them.

			<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="Player Responsibilities" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="7">
				<rich_text>Players have one, primary responsibility that might be more important than any other thing going on in the game.  It's pretty simple: Don't turtle. Don't retreat into an impeneratable shell and refuse to be engaged. Have your character do things and pursue goals. Interact with the setting and see what interests you. If nothing does then talk to the GM about adding parts to the setting that would interest you. Do something! The only thing that really causes the game to fail completely is players that don't interact and get bored. Don't be part of that problem.  </rich_text>

		<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="The Basic System" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="8">
			<rich_text>When it comes time to pull out the dice and engage the rule systems in this book, there is one primary system that gets used more than any other and is at the core of the game; the Attribute Check. This check is super easy. The player rolls 1d20 and adds the appropriate attribute and compares it to a Difficulty. If the result of the roll is equal to or higher than the Difficulty then the Check is a success; otherwise, it is a failure.  The standard Difficulties are:  
  
Easy:         5  
Normal:       10  
Moderate:     15  
Hard:         20  
Very Hard:    25  
Extreme:      30  
 
Generally a natural roll of 1 is always a failure and a natural roll of 20 always succeeds.  
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example: Arrack the Fighter wants to push a boulder out of the way. The GM thinks the boulder is big but not impossible to move so assigns a Moderate Difficulty (15) to the Check. Moving the boulder is something that primarily requires Strength, so Arrack will use his Strength +2. Arrack's player rolls 1d20 and the result is 13. After adding the +2 for Strength the final result is 15. That equals the Difficulty so Arrack is able to push the boulder. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 
</rich_text>
			<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="Modifiers" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="9">
				<rich_text>Each Attribute Check gets a bonus based on the characters level. This is shown in the table below.

Level   AB
----------
1       +1
2       +1
3       +1
4       +2
5       +2
6       +2
7       +3
8       +3
9       +3
10      +4
11      +4
12      +4
13      +4
14      +5
15      +5
16      +5
17      +5
18      +6
19      +6
20      +6

If the character has a Skill that can be applied to the situation, then the player can add a +4 bonus to the roll.

Other modifiers can come into play when making a check. It could be raining, so the footing is bad when trying to push the boulder out of the way. Arrock could be distracted by goblins firing arrows at him. Any number of things. The rule of thumb is this, if the situation causes the task to get easier, add 2 to the roll. If it makes the task harder, subtract 2 from the roll. The GM can make any modifications to these numbers that she feels appropriate.

			<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="Taking 10" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="10">
				<rich_text>If a character isn't in any danger while attempting a task and she would succeed on a roll of 10, she can simply Take 10 instead of rolling. That means simply assuming that the roll comes up 10. This eliminates the weird failures of what should be somewhat routine tasks.

				<rich_text>As the game is played, players are rewarded for defeating foes, completing quests and good role-playing. The primary reward is Experience Points.  Each character starts with 0 Experience Points.  When the character gets enough Experience Points according to the chart below they can move to the next level.  They immediately get all the benefits and powers of the new level.

			<node custom_icon_id="0" foreground="" is_bold="False" name="Attributes" prog_lang="custom-colors" readonly="False" tags="" unique_id="72">
				<rich_text>Each character has 6 Attributes that describe their character's natural ability and range in value from -2 to +4. A -2 represents disability or incompetence while and +4 represents to peak of talent. Each Attribute gives the character either bonuses or penalties on rolls that involve those Attributes. The bonus / penalty is equal to the value of the Attribute.

Strength: Strength measures a character's physical power. It is an importan Attribute for Fighters or anyone who is involved in melee combat as its bonus / penalty is applied to all melee to hit and damage rolls.

Dexterity: This Attribute measures how agile or manually dextrous a character is. Want to be good at picking locks or doing hand stands? Dexterity is your Attribute. It also gets applied to Armor Class and Reflex Defense so it is useful to everyone. It is very important to Thieves.

Constitution: This measures how healthy and hardy a character is. It affects Hit Points and Fortitude Defense and is useful to everyone. It is most important to anyone who is going to be on the front lines of fighting and is going to be taking a lot of damage. 

Intelligence: Intelligence indicates how smart and how educated a character is. It determines the number of spells a Mage can cast so it is obviously a very importan Attribute for them. However, it also determines the number of Other Skills a character starts with so it is a good Attribute for anyone.

Wisdom: This Attribute measures common sense and spiritual / mental strength. Clerics gain the most from a high Wisdom by increasing the number of Prayers they know and making the recharge roll easier. However, all characters benefit from Wisdom's affect on their Willpower Defense.

Charisma: Charisma is the strength of a character's personality and sometimes a general sense of their attractiveness. Clerics and Mages both benefit the most from high Charisma.

			<rich_text>To create a starting character follow theses steps. We will create a starting character as an example.  
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">1. Generate Attribute scores.  </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

There are three methods to generate attribute scores. You have to pick one or perhaps your GM indicates everyone is using a particular method.

The Random Method: For each attribute roll 1d6-2. This will generate a score for that attribute that range from -1 to +4. This method will produce very random character statistics. GM's might want to allow players to reroll or choose another method if the sum of all the character's attributes is less than 1.

The Point Buy: You have 7 points to distribute between your attributes. All attributes start with a value of 0.  Each point assigned to an attribute raises it by 1.  If you take a negative value for an attribute, you get that number of additional points to assign to other attributes.  No attribute may be lower than -2 or greater than +4.

The Attribute Array: You simply take the following array of attribute scores and assign them to your character's attributes as you see fit: -1, 0, 1, 2, 2, 4.

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example:
  
Using the Random method we rolled and get: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">2. Decide the character's Race. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 
  
We generate the rolls first to see what scores we have to work with in determining race and class. Races other than human can have minimum and maximum attribute values. It is possible to roll a set of scores than would not be able to choose a race or class. Not likely but possible. 

If we are doing the Point Buy or the Attribute Array, we can hold off on deciding our attribute scores until we have chosen our race and class. 

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example: 

Our random scores are sufficient to be any race or class so we decide to make a Gnome since we've never played one before.  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>

  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">3. Decide the character's class. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 
  
Gnomes make pretty darn good Mages so we'll go with that.  
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">4. Assign the scores to the Attributes as desired. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 
  
For a Mage, Intelligence and Charisma are the most important Attributes. We also know that our Gnome gets a +1 to its Intelligence attribute. Given that we put our two highest rolls in Intelligence and Charisma.   

We have a low score of -1 which will give us a penalty. Since we envision our short little gnome as being a bit of a scrawny fellow and not much of a front line fighter we put the -1 in Strength.  
  
Dexterity is useful in not getting hit so we put a good score there. Then we put our other two rolls in Constitution and Wisdom.  

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example: 

Original Rolls: -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3  
Gnome Mage Level 1  
Str: -1     Dex: +2     Con: +0   
Int: +4     Wis: +1     Cha: +3  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">5. Determine calculated Attributes. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 
  
Starting Hit Points are 10 plus the character's class hit die plus the Constitution attribute.

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example: 

So our gnome has 10 + 1d4 + Constitution. We roll a 3, that gives us a total of 13.  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Our gnome mage has an Attack Bonus of zero.  
  
Our class gives us 1 Mana plus our Charisma. Our Race allows us to add our Intelligence in as well. This gives us 8 Mana.  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
Armor Class and Reflex Defenses are based on Dexterity, Fortitude is based on Constitution and Willpower is based on Wisdom.  
  
HP: 13  AB: +0  Mana: 8  
AC: 12  Fort: 10    Ref: 12     Will: 11  
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">5. Choose Spells, Prayers and Thief Abilities. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

We don't have Prayers or Thief Abilities but we do get 1 plus our Intelligence bonus as Spell selections. That means we get 5. We think a mix of 2 attack spell, 2 defense spell and 1 miscellaneous spell is probably good. We are 1st level so only 1st level spells are available to us.  

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example:
  
Spells: Mage Armor, Shield, Magic Missle, Burning Hands, Identify  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">6. Choose Skills. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

We get 3 plus Intelligence bonus (7) in Skills.  

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example:

Skills: Stonemason (+1 Gnome), Spellcraft, Language (Sylvan, Dwarven), Cooking, Ancient History, Appraising, </rich_text>
			<rich_text>Brewing
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">7. Pick Equipment. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

We handle starting equipment simply. Our gnome can have any non-magical equipment that our GM deems reasonable for the game. He then gets 1d10 starting gold pieces left over.  
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example:

We choose: Leather armor, Bow, Arrows (20), Dagger, Backpack (50' rope, 1 torch, 7 days rations, waterskin, Spellbook)  </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">8. Determine Combat stats and recalculated any Attributes that might have changed. </rich_text>
			<rich_text> 

Buying equipment or chosing skills might have some affect on our calculated attributes. 

</rich_text>
			<rich_text style="italic">Example:
  
Leather Armor bumps our AC to 13.  
  
Weapons:        AB  Damage  #Att  
Bow             +2  1d6     1  
Dagger          -1  1d6-1   1  
Dagger(Thrown)  +2  1d6     1 </rich_text>
			<rich_text>
  
</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">9. Pick a name. </rich_text>

Humans are also more social and tolerant than most other races, accepting the company of elves, dwarves, and the like with noticeably less complaint.

Duration: 1 hour  
  
An unseen servant is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that performs simple tasks at your command. It can run and fetch things, open unstuck doors, and hold chairs, as well as clean and mend. The servant can perform only one activity at a time, but it repeats the same activity over and over again if told to do so as long as you remain within range. It can open only normal doors, drawers, lids, and the like. It can lift 20 pounds or drag 100 pounds. It can trigger traps and such, but it can exert only 20 pounds of force, which is not enough to activate certain pressure plates and other devices. It can’t perform any task that requires a skill check.  

  
The servant cannot attack in any way; it is never allowed an attack roll. It cannot be killed, but it dissipates if it takes 6 points of damage from area attacks. It has a Defense of 5 against attacks. If you attempt to send it beyond the spell’s range, measured from your current position, the servant ceases to exist.

Alarm sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the alarm. You decide at the time of casting whether the alarm will be mental or audible.  
  
Mental Alarm  
A mental alarm alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A silence spell has no effect on a mental alarm.  
  
Audible Alarm  
An audible alarm produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall. In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a silence spell cannot hear the ringing.

Range: Personal  
Target: You  
Duration: 1 minute  

Several illusory duplicates of you pop into being, making it difficult for enemies to know which target to attack. The figments stay near you and disappear when struck.

Mirror image creates 1d4+1 images. These figments separate from you and remain in a cluster near you. The figments mimic your actions, pretending to cast spells when you cast a spell, drink potions when you drink a potion, levitate when you levitate, and so on.

Enemies attempting to attack you or cast spells at you must select from among indistinguishable targets. Generally, roll randomly to see whether the selected target is real or a figment. Any successful attack against an image destroys it. An image’s AC is 10 + your Dex. 

An attacker must be able to see the images to be fooled. If you are invisible or an attacker shuts his or her eyes, the spell has no effect. (Being unable to see carries its own penalties.)

				<rich_text>Web
Casting Time: 1 Action  
Range: 100 ft  
Target: 20 foot radius area  
Duration: 10 minutes

Web creates a many-layered mass of strong, sticky strands. These strands trap those caught in them. The strands are similar to spider webs but far larger and tougher. These masses must be anchored to two or more solid and diametrically opposed points or else the web collapses upon itself and disappears. Creatures caught within a web become entangled among the gluey fibers. Attacking a creature in a web won’t cause you to become entangled.

Make a ranged attack roll against the Reflex defense of any creatures in the effect's area when the spell is cast.  If the attack succeeds, the creature is entangled and can’t move from its space, but can break loose by spending 1 round and making a DC 15 Strength check or a DC 20 Escape Artist check. If this attack fails, the creature is entangled, but not prevented from moving, though moving is more difficult than normal for being entangled. Once loose a creature moves 5 feet per round until out of the webbing.

The strands of a web spell are flammable. A magic flaming sword can slash them away as easily as a hand brushes away cobwebs. Any fire can set the webs alight and burn away 5 square feet in 1 round. All creatures within flaming webs take 2d4 points of fire damage from the flames.

Casting Time: 1 Action  
Range: Touch 
Target: 1 rope
Duration: 1 hour

When this spell is cast upon a piece of rope from 5 to 30 feet long, one end of the rope rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground, as if affixed at the upper end. The upper end is, in fact, fastened to an extradimensional space that is outside the multiverse. Creatures in the extradimensional space are hidden, beyond the reach of spells (including divinations), unless those spells work across planes. The space holds as many as eight creatures (of any size). Creatures in the space can pull the rope up into the space, making the rope “disappear.” In that case, the rope counts as one of the eight creatures that can fit in the space. The rope can support up to 16,000 pounds. A weight greater than that can pull the rope free.

Spells cannot be cast across the extradimensional interface, nor can area effects cross it. Those in the extradimensional space can see out of it as if a 3-foot by 5-foot window were centered on the rope. The window is present on the Material Plane, but it’s invisible, and even creatures that can see the window can’t see through it. Anything inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends. The rope can be climbed by only one person at a time. The rope trick spell enables climbers to reach a normal place if they do not climb all the way to the extradimensional space.

		<rich_text>A cleric can cast any prayer he knows.  Prayers are divided into 3 Tiers per Domain. At each level a cleric can have a certain number of Domains. The first time a character chooses a Domain he gets access to the Tier 1 prayers.  The second time the Domain is chosen he gets the Tier 2 prayers.  The third time he gets Tier 3.  A cleric cannot choose a Domain twice in a row. He must choose another Domain between.

Example: At first level Bob the Righteous gets 1 Domain. He chooses the Good Domain. He now has access to the Tier 1 Good Prayers. At 5th Level Bob gets another Domain. He cannot choose Good because that is what he chose last time.  This time Bob chooses Protection. He now has access to the Tier 1 prayers for the Good and Protection Domains.  At 8th level Bob can again choose the Good Domain or any other Domain except the Protection Domain. He chooses the Good Domain. He can now access the Tier 1 and 2 Prayers of the Good Domain and the Tier 1 Prayers of the Protection Domain.

Tier 1 Powers may be used once per Encounter. They recharge at the end of an Encounter and are immediately usable again.

Tier 2 Powers may be used once and then are recharged at a Short Rest or Long Rest.

Tier 3 Powers may be used once and then are only recharged at a Long Rest.

Heal Wounds: The cleric can heal an ally with a simple touch. The target gets 1d8 hit points instantly healed, +1 per level of the cleric.

Minor Restoration: Dispels any magical effects reducing one of the subject’s ability scores or cures 1d4 points of temporary ability damage to one of the subject’s ability scores. It does not restore permanent ability drain or level drain.

Restoration</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">:</rich_text>
			<rich_text> Functions like minor restoration, except that it also dispels negative levels and restores one experience level to a creature who has had a level drained. The drained level is restored only if the time since the creature lost the level is equal to or less than one day per caster level. A character who has a level restored by restoration has exactly the minimum number of experience points necessary to restore him or her to his or her previous level.

Restoration cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). 

Restoration does not restore levels or Constitution points lost due to death.

Sanctuary: The cleric makes a Charisma attack vs Willpower against any foe that wants to attack him. If the attack is successful then the foe cannot attack for the duration of the prayer. If the attack is not successful then the foe can attack normally. The cleric attacking an enemy instantly negates the effects of the prayer on that enemy. The prayer lasts for 2d4 rounds. 

Shield Other: This prayer wards the subject and creates a mystic connection between you and the subject so that some of its wounds are transferred to you. The subject gains a +1 to all defences. Additionally, the subject takes only half damage from all wounds and attacks that deal hit point damage. The amount of damage not taken by the warded creature is taken by you.

Obscuring Mist: A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary once created. The vapor obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. The mist lasts for 1 minute per level of the cleric.

Wind Wall: A vertical wall of wind 10 feet long and 5 feet high per cleric level springs up. It is 2 feet thick and of considerable strength. Small flying creatures cannot fly through it. Arrows and crossbow bolts automatically miss if fired through it. Larger projectiles suffer a -4 chance to hit. Giant sized projectiles and seige engines are unaffected. The effect lasts until the end of the encounter.

Gaseous Form: The cleric or a touched subject and all its gear become insubstantial, misty, and translucent. A gaseous creature can’t run, but it can fly at a speed of 10 feet. It can pass through small holes or narrow openings, even mere cracks, with all it was wearing or holding in its hands, as long as the spell persists. The creature is subject to the effects of wind, and it can’t enter water or other liquid. It also can’t manipulate objects or activate items, even those carried along with its gaseous form. Continuously active items remain active, though in some cases their effects may be moot. The effects last for 2 minutes per cleric level.

Air Walk</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">:</rich_text>
			<rich_text> The cleric or a touched target can tread on air as if walking on solid ground. Moving upward is similar to walking up a hill. The maximum upward or downward angle possible is 45 degrees, at a rate equal to one-half the air walker’s normal speed. The effect lasts for 10 minutes per cleric level.

Whirlwind: This prayer creates a powerful cyclone of raging wind that moves through the air, along the ground, or over water at a speed of 60 feet per round. You can concentrate on controlling the cyclone’s every movement or give it simple instructions. Directing the cyclone’s movement or changing its instructions counts as your action for the round and occurs in the Missile / Movement phase. The cyclone always moves during your turn on the Movement phase. If the cyclone gets more than 500 feet from you, it moves in a random, uncontrolled fashion for 1d3 rounds and then dissipates. You can’t regain control of the cyclone, even if comes back within range.

Any Large or smaller creature that comes in contact with the spell effect is attacked at your Base Attack Bonus versus Reflex. A successful attack does 3d6 points of damage. A Medium or smaller creature that takes this damage is attacked again. A success on this attack means the creature is picked up bodily by the cyclone and held suspended in its powerful winds, taking 1d8 points of damage each round on your turn with no save allowed. You may direct the cyclone to eject any carried creatures whenever you wish, depositing the hapless souls wherever the cyclone happens to be when they are released.

This prayer lasts for 1 round per cleric level.</rich_text>

Entangle: Grasses, weeds, bushes, and even trees wrap, twist, and entwine about creatures in a 20 foot radius area within 100 feet of the cleric, holding them fast and causing them to become entangled. Caster makes an attack mofified by Wis against each creature in the area's Reflex defence. A successful attack means the target is immobilized. An immobilized target can use it's turn to attempt to break free with a Strength or Escape Artist check against DC 15. Each round that any creature is in the area the cleric makes an attack roll to immobilize them. The effect last for 1d4 +1 round per level of the cleric.

Barkskin: The cleric can touch a target and cause its skin to become hard and bark-like. The target gets a +2 bonus to AC that lasts for 10 minutes per level of the cleric. The bonus gets an additional +1 for every 5 cleric levels.

Wall of Thorns: The cleric can create a wall of thorns that blocks movement. The wall is 10 feet long per cleric level and 5 feet wide. Anyone caught in the wall when it is cast or attempts to move through the wall takes damage: 1d10 for no armor, 1d8 for light armor and 1d6 for medium.  Those in heavy armor or its equivalent are unaffected. Someone can push through the 5 foot width of the wall with a successful Strength check vs a DC of 15. The wall lasts for 10 minutes per cleric level.

Animate Plants</rich_text>

Shambler: This prayer creates 1d4+2 large Shambling Mounds. The creatures willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. The creatures remain with you for seven days unless you dismiss them. If the shamblers are created only for guard duty, however, the duration of the spell is seven months. In this case, the shamblers can only be ordered to guard a specific site or location. Shamblers summoned to guard duty cannot move outside the spell’s range, which is measured from the point where each first appeared.

Calm Animals: Cleric can cause all animals within 30 feet to become docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals can be affected by the spell. If the animal is trained to attack or guard then the cleric must succeed at an base attack plus his Charisma vs the animal's Will defence. The effect lasts for 1 minute per cleric level.

Dominate Animal: You can enchant an animal and direct it with simple commands such as “Attack,” “Run,” and “Fetch.” Suicidal or self-destructive commands (including an order to attack a creature much larger than the dominated animal) are simply ignored.

Summon Nature's Ally: The cleric can summon a natural animal. The animal appears within 25 feet of the cleric. It attacks the clerics opponents to the best of its ability. The cleric must be able to communicate with the animal in order to direct it to attack specific foes or to do other specific actions. The cleric cannot summon an animal with more hit dice than his cleric level. The animal stays for 1 round per cleric level and then disappears.

Commune with Nature</rich_text>
			<rich_text weight="heavy">:</rich_text>
			<rich_text> The cleric instantly gains knowledge of as many as three facts from among the following subjects: the ground or terrain, plants, minerals, bodies of water, people, general animal population, presence of woodland creatures, presence of powerful unnatural creatures, or even the general state of the natural setting. In outdoor settings, the effect spans a radius of 1 mile per caster level. In natural underground settings—caves, caverns, and the like—the radius is limited to 100 feet per caster level. The prayer does not function where nature has been replaced by construction or settlement, such as in dungeons and towns.

Shapechange: The cleric can assume the shape of any animal with equal or fewer hit dice than his cleric levels.

Heat Metal: Cleric causes metal on targeted creatures within 25 feet to get hot and potentially cause damage.  The cleric can target 1 creature for every 2 cleric levels.  Damage is caused according to the chart below.  If the metal on the creature isn't worn or is very small then it takes minimum damage.

Sometimes one side of the combat is able to get the jump on their opponents. When this happens there is a surprise round.

			<rich_text>The basic attack action consists of rolling a d20, adding the character's Attack Bonus, adding any other relevant modifiers and comparing the result to the target's Armor Class. If the modified roll meets or exceeds the Armor Class the attack hits. Otherwise, it misses.

A roll of 20 on the d20 always hits and does maximum damage.

A roll of 1 on the d20 always misses.

Modifiers to the Attack

The simple rule is that if there is something that gives the attacking character an advantage on an attack roll, the players gets a +2 bonus to the roll. If there is a situation that gives the character a disadvantage on a roll then the player gets a -2 penalty on the roll.

Any unusual situations that don't seem to fall within these paramenters are left up to the GM to adjudicate.

Melee Attacks

Characters that engage in combat with melee weapons are considered to be engaged. Characters that are engaged are concentrating on attacking and defending themselves from the immediate threat that is in front of them.

If a character attacks a foe in melee that is engaged, he gets a +2 bonus to the attack. It is hard to defend against attacks from multiple opponents. 

Ranged Attacks

Ranged attacks are modified by the range to the target. Ranged weapons have range bands of: close, medium, long and extreme. The attack is normal at close range but recieves a -2 penalty for every range band beyond close. Ranged weapons cannot attack effectively beyond Extreme range.

If a character makes a ranged attack against a foe that is engaged with an ally, he must apply a -2 penalty to his attack to avoid hitting his ally.

Range Bands

Fighting with 2 Weapons:

Fighting with 2 weapons gets a -2 penalty on each weapon and the offhand weapon does not get any Strength bonus to damage.

Fighting Defensively

Sometimes a character just doesn't want to get hit. If he foregoes his attacks, he may apply his Attack Bonus to his Armor Class for that round. This must be declared before any attacks are rolled against him that round.</rich_text>

			<rich_text>Characters have 4 Defense scores: Armor Class, Reflex, Fortitude and Willpower.

Armor Class is the most frequently used in combat. It represents how difficult it is to hit and damage the character with weapons.

Reflex is used against attacks in which armor would be no defense and only dodging out of the way is effective. Many area of effect attacks and traps attack this defense.

Fortitude represents how hardy the character is and how resistant he is against physical harm. Poisons and disease attack this defense.

Willpower represents how mentally / spiritually tough the character is. Many spells target this defense.
 
All Defenses start with a value of 10 and are adjusted by a character's Attribute modifiers as on the table below.

Defense Scores
--------------
Armor Class     10 + Dex + Armor
Reflex          10 + Dex
Fortitude       10 + Con
Willpower       10 + Wis

			<rich_text>

Sometimes it is prudent to run away. If a character is engaged in melee and wishes to break off combat and flee, he has two options.

The first is to simply turn tail and use two full movements to get away as quickly as possible. If the character does this all his opponents who are engaged with him get a free attack as he flees.

The second is to withdraw slowly in an attempt to get away. The character foregoes any attacks and moves 6” directly away from his opponent.

While he cannot move as quickly, no oppenent gets a free attack this way.</rich_text>

			<rich_text>If an attack is successful, generally the target takes damage. The attacker rolls whatever his damage dice are and subtracts that amount from his Hit Points.

If a target's Hit Points drop to 0 or below, the target is unconscious and begins making Stabilization rolls. When the target is a monster the GM will often simplify this process by having the monster die automatically when it reaches 0 Hit Points.

Stabilization rolls happen each round on the unconscious character's turn. The player (or GM) rolls a d20. A result of 10 or better is considered a success; 9 or worse is a failure. If the player achieves 3 successes before 3 failures then the character stabilizes and is in no danger of dying unless it takes more damage. If the player gets 3 failures before 3 sucesses then the character dies.

Another character can attempt to stabilize the unconscious character. To do so the player moves his character adjacent to the unconscious character and then spends his turn stabilizing the unconscious character. He rolls his First Aid skill versus an Easy Difficulty. A success stabilizes the character and no more stabilization rolls need to be made.

Giving the unconscious character a healing potion or casting a healing spell causes the character to regain consciousness and gives them the appropriate number of hit points.

Recovery

As the characters adventure, they are continually using up and losing their resources in terms of Hit Points, Mana, potions, etc. Eventually they will need to rest and recover. There are two ways this happens.

First, the characters can take a Short Rest. A Short Rest means they stop somewhere for at least 30 minutes of game time and take a breather. During this rest they can undertake no strenuous activity. You cannot take multiple Short Rests in a row. An encounter must take place between Short Rests. The benefits of a Short Rest are:

Each character has a number of hit dice equal to his level, to a maximum of 10. The die size is the same in which that character rolls for Hit Points. At a Short Rest, the characters may roll any number of their Hit Dice to regain Hit Points. Once rolled, those Hit Dice may not be used again until after a Long Rest (described below).

Second, once per 24 hour period the characters may take a Long Rest. A Long Rest is at least 8 hours long, during which at least 4 hours are spent sleeping.  When not sleeping the character may not undertake any strenuous activity. The benefits of a Long Rest are:

1 – All the character's Hit Dice are recharged.
2 – All Mana is recovered.
4 – Each character recovers their level + Constitution in hit points.</rich_text>

		<rich_text>Ring of Iron Will: +2 to Willpower Defense.

Amulet of Health: +2 to Fortitude Defense.

Cloak of Shadows: +2 to Stealth rolls.

Shortbow of Speed: User gets 1 additional attack per round.

Ring of Blindsight: Wearer can see in total darkness.

Wands: These items are approximately 1 foot long and slender. They are made from a variety of materials but all do basically the same thing. They can store spells to be used later. They have a Mana point maximum that sets the limit for what they can cast.  If a spell costs the Mage 5 Mana to cast normally then it takes up 5 Mana from the Wand's capacity. Once the spell is cast from the Wand, those Mana are once again available. Once the spell is cast from the Wand, the spell must be recast into the Wand before it can be used again. The maximum any Wand can store is 10 Mana. 

Staff: Works just like a Wand except the item is larger and stores more Mana worth of spells. Staves store between 15 and 25 Mana worth of spells.

Mana Crystals: These crystals store Mana for use later. Each day the Mage can elect to put any or all of his available Mana into the crystal. That Mana is used up for the day as if he had cast a spell and used it.  The Mana then stays in the crystal indefinitely until the Mage decides to use it later.

Ring of Protection: This ring gives a bonus (+1, +2 or +3) to all the wearer's defenses.

Brooch of Warding: Absorbs spells cast at the wearer. The brooch starts with 30 spell levels. Every time a spell is cast at the wearer, the effect is negated and the level of that spell is subtracted from the brooch's total. When the brooch has 0 levels left, it becomes a non-magical ornament.  The brooch only protects the wearer from spells that specifically target the caster. Area effect spells and the like are unaffected. The brooch protects from friendly and non-friendly spells both.

Lightning Staff: This is a +2 staff that stores 10 Mana and has the following special abilities:
    1 / day - Lightning Bolt
    3 / day - Shocking Grasp
    3 / day - Thunderclap (Int attack vs Will in a 20 foot cone. Success stuns the target for 1d4 rounds. Stunned targets can cast no spells or use any magical items and make all rolls at a -2 penalty.)
    
Holy Symbol: Gives a bonus to the cleric to retain their spells after casting. The pluses generally range from +1 to +5.

Rod of Turning: +3 to Turning Undead attack roll.</rich_text>
