Race and Class are the two primary defining characteristics of a character. There are 6 races to choose from: Human, Half-Elf, Halfling, Dwarf, Elf, Gnome.  A character's race bestows some benefits and some restrictions.  All the races except human have some minimum and maximum attribute requirements to take.  All races except humans have class and level limits. Level limits do not keep the character from progressing past that level but it does mean the number of experience points needed in that class double after that level.
